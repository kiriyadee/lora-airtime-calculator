   * Calculates the LoRa airtime in milliseconds.

   * See https://lora-developers.semtech.com/library/product-documents/ for the
   * equations in AN1200.13 "LoRa Modem Designerâ€™s Guide".
   *
   * Spreading factor and bandwidth together define the so called data rate.
   *
   * @param size full packet size. For LoRaWAN this includes the LoRaWAN MAC
   *   header (about 9 bytes when no MAC commands are included), the application
   *   payload, and the MIC (4 bytes).
   * @param sf spreading factor, 6..12 (6 is not used in LoRaWAN)
   * @param bw bandwidth in kHz, typically 125, 250 or 500
   * @param codingRate coding rate, '4/5', '4/6', '4/7' or '4/8'. For LoRaWAN
   *   this is always '4/5'.
   * @param lowDrOptimize low data rate optimization, 'auto', true or false.
   *   This is usually enabled for low data rates, to avoid issues with drift
   *   of the crystal reference oscillator due to either temperature change or
   *   motion. When enabled, specifically for 125 kHz bandwidth and SF11 and
   *   SF12, this adds a small overhead to increase robustness to reference
   *   frequency variations over the timescale of the packet.
   * @param explicitHeader if the LoRa header is present, true or false. This
   *   is the low-level header that defines, e.g., coding rate, payload length
   *   and the presence of a CRC checksum. In plain LoRa it can be left out if
   *   each transmission uses the very same parameters and the receiver is
   *   aware of those. For LoRaWAN, where at least the payload length is not
   *   fixed, the low-level LoRa header is always enabled.
   * @param preambleLength number of preamble symbols. For LoRaWAN this is 8.
